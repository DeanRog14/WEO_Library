A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the prices of goods and services that households consume. Such changes affect the real purchasing power of consumers' incomes and their welfare. As the prices of different goods and services do not all change at the same rate, a price index can only reflect their average movement. A price index is typically assigned a value of unity, or 100, in some reference period and the values of the index for other periods of time are intended to indicate the average proportionate, or percentage, change in prices from this price reference period. Price indices can also be used to measure differences in price levels between different cities, regions or countries at the same point in time.

The new index, starting from August 2022, has updated its weights from 2002 to 2019, and expanded coverage to include the entire country instead of just Conakry as in the previous index. It was developed with technical assistance from AFRISTAT and reviewed by STA. The figures presented in the tables rely only on Conakry’s information, as there is insufficient data available for the other regions to calculate an annual average. Further changes will need to be accommodated once there is sufficient data availability to transition to the full-country index. The new CPI results in a lower inflation rate at the end of 2022 and a faster decline in inflation in 2023.

698,ZWE,PCPI,Zimbabwe,"Inflation, average consumer prices","Expressed in averages for the year, not end-of-period data. A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the prices of goods and services that households consume. Such changes affect the real purchasing power of consumers' incomes and their welfare. As the prices of different goods and services do not all change at the same rate, a price index can only reflect their average movement. A price index is typically assigned a value of unity, or 100, in some reference period and the values of the index for other periods of time are intended to indicate the average proportionate, or percentage, change in prices from this price reference period. Price indices can also be used to measure differences in price levels between different cities, regions or countries at the same point in time.
